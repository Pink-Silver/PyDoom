PyDoom
------
A port of the game DOOM to the Python scripting language, aiming for
maximum flexibility through modding.

IMPORTANT: You will need the Cython and cx_Freeze packages from PyPI if you're
running PyDoom from source. Otherwise, you will be unable to build the C
extensions or the binaries.

Running
~~~~~~~
If you're running from source, make sure you have Python 3.5 installed
beforehand. It will not run with earlier versions.

Since the package is mostly Python, very little is needed to run it. Just run:

[source]
----
MakeZip.py resourcezip PyDoomResource.zip
setup_extensions.py build_ext --inplace
----

The second command will only work in a VC or SDK build prompt on Windows.

Everything else should take care of itself. You only need to run these once, or
if you change the resource zip directory or the C extensions, though you should
not ever need to.

Building a binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're building an executable, you will need the cx_Freeze package
installed. You only need to run one command in your VC/SDK build prompt:

[source]
----
build_all.py
----

and everything else will be taken care of for you.
